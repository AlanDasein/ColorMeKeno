**ColorMe Keno**

To play COLORME KENO select between 2 and 10 balls from the group of 80 balls located on the board. Once the game begins, each ball will be given a color from a set of 5 different colors. These 5 colors will be evenly distributed among the 80 balls. That is, each color will be present in 16 balls after all the balls have been "colored". The goal is to gather as many colors as possible in the set of selected balls. Wins are based on the number of balls selected, the largest number of balls of the same color achieved and the number of credits bet.
